PDF Data Extractor – Delivery Guide

Thank you for your order! Please find below instructions and details for using your PDF-Data Extraction app.

---------------------------------------------------
How the App Works
---------------------------------------------------

1. Go to the hosted web app: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Shami96/PDF-Data_Extractor

2. Upload your Word (docx) template and PDF file via the interface.

3. The app will extract all relevant data from the PDF and update your Word template by replacing red text or placeholders.

4. You can download the processed Word file with all fields automatically filled using advanced AI and OCR where needed.

---------------------------------------------------
OpenAI API Key – Important
---------------------------------------------------

- **The app uses OpenAI’s API for accurate and automated extraction.**
- The current deployment is running on my (the developer's) OpenAI API key for demo/testing only.
- For ongoing production use, you must use your **own API key** for security, privacy, and to avoid usage limits.

**How to get your OpenAI API Key:**
1. Sign up for a free account at https://platform.openai.com/signup.
2. Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.
3. Click “Create new secret key”, copy it, and keep it safe.
4. Send this API key to me if you want me to update the deployed app for your usage (or follow instructions in the README for self-hosting).

**Why?**
- Using your own API key ensures your data remains private and you control the usage/cost.
- You can monitor, upgrade, or restrict API usage as you wish.
